                    "Betawi culture is a culture that I encounter in my daily life as a resident of Jakarta. Betawi is the original culture of Jakarta (formerly Batavia), the capital of Indonesia, which every immigrant from outside Jakarta will definitely encounter. In the picture, a female dancer is depicted dancing a mask dance while holding an ondel-ondel mask. Ondel-ondel is one of the icons of Betawi culture, which is very iconic and commonly found. Male ondel-ondel wears red masks, while female ondel-ondel wears white masks. One of the traditional dances from Betawi that is quite famous is the Betawi mask dance. I drew two different types of masks so the drawing wouldn't look monotonous and repetitive and so the drawing itself may give more insights through its diverse elements. Not only from the aspect of icons and traditional dance but also from the culinary and ornamental sides. Behind the dancer, you can see Betawi food, namely crocodile bread. The crocodile bread is drawn in such a way that the viewers may understand its soft texture and warmth. The ornament I picked is called a gigi balang, usually found in typical Betawi buildings such as restaurants or traditional residents' houses. All of these elements are combined and composed into a complete work that fully reflects Betawi culture from various aspects, of course, which can help the audience better understand Betawi culture from a different perspective."
