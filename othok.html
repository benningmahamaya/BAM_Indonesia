                    Our exhibition also displays a variety of traditional Indonesian toys, one of them being Kapal Othok-Othok, meaning Othok-Othok Boat.

                    "Kapal Othok Othok" is a traditional wooden toy boat from Indonesia, particularly popular in the island of Java. The name "Otok Otok" comes from the sound it makes when the toy moves through the water. These toys are often handmade by local artisans and are popular among children for their simplicity and entertainment value.

                    The design of Kapal Othok Othok typically features a simple boat shape with a flat bottom and a pointed bow. A small propeller is attached to the back of the boat, which is connected to a shaft that runs through the hull. When the boat is placed in water and pushed forward, the propeller spins, creating a bubbling sound and propelling the boat forward.

                    Kapal Othok Othok is often made from lightweight wood, such as balsa wood, and painted in bright colors. The simplicity of its design allows it to be easily operated by children, who can enjoy watching it move through the water and listening to the sound it makes.
